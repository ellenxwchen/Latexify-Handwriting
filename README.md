# Latexify-Handwriting

Handwritten Mathematical Expressions Recognition (HMER) is the field of converting handwritten mathematical expressions (Figure 1) to their LaTeX representation (Figure 2)–this is the goal of our project. This project is useful because scientific documents have been handwritten for centuries (Figure 3), but currently, the main source of communication is the Internet; it is therefore important to have a tool that can convert expressions into a compatible representation [1]. Converting expressions–such as the one seen in Figure 1–manually is tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming [2]. Machine learning can reduce the time and error associated with converting expressions manually. Machine learning is an appropriate tool because we need to classify several characters, which can be done by training a deep network with a large dataset of labelled characters. Further, OpenCV can be used for image segmentation to extract single characters.
