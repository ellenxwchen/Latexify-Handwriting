# Latexify-Handwriting

## Introduction
Handwritten Mathematical Expressions Recognition (HMER) is the field of converting handwritten mathematical expressions to their LaTeX representation â€“this is the goal of our project. This project is useful because scientific documents have been handwritten for centuries, but currently, the main source of communication is the Internet; it is therefore important to have a tool that can convert expressions into a compatible representation. Machine learning is an appropriate tool because we need to classify several characters, which can be done by training a deep network with a large dataset of labelled characters. 

Our model carries support for over 89 characters, including integrals, fractions, trigonometric equations, as well as subscripts and superscripts. 

## How It Works

## Model Architecture
We used ResNet34, one of the best models used for object classification. We fine-tuned ResNet34 and re-trained it on our dataset to update the parameters. ResNet34 has 34 layers in total, with 5 types of convolutional layers, followed by a DRF and a fully-connected layer. We added the linear fully-connected layer to account for the 89 output features that we have. Through rigorous hyperparameter tuning, we decided on selecting the following hyperparameters: batch size of 1000, number of epochs to 30, weight decay of 0, and learning rate of 0.001. We utilized the Adam Optimizer, and kept the original ReLU activation function.

## Results
The highest training accuracy achieved was 99%, validation accuracy is 97% and test accuracy of 95.7%.
